<!-- SUBTITLE: How to setup authentication on your wiki. -->

Requarks Wiki supports 4 types of authentication providers. You may choose to use one, some or all of them at the same time.

> :warning: You must have at least 1 provider enabled as edits can only be performed while authenticated.{.is-warning}
# Local
The local provider stores user accounts in the wiki database. It does not rely on any 3rd party service and accounts are unique to your wiki.

This is the most simple solution and is enabled by default.
# Microsoft Account
The Microsoft Account provider lets users login using their own Microsoft account.
# Google ID
The Google ID provider lets users login using their own Google ID.
# Facebook
The Facebook provider lets users login using their own Facebook login.
