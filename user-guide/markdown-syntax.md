# What is Markdown
Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax designed so that it can be converted to HTML and many other formats using a tool by the same name. Markdown is often used to format readme files, for writing messages in online discussion forums, and to create rich text using a plain text editor.

# Basics
## Bold
To make a text in bold, simply put double asterisks `**` before and after the desired text:

`To **boldly** go`  
becomes  
To **boldly** go

## Italic

To make a text in italic, simply put a single asterisk `*` before and after the desired text:

`Some *italic* text`  
becomes  
Some *italic* text
