# MongoDB
MongoDB is a free and open-source cross-platform document-oriented database program. Classified as a NoSQL database program, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents with schemas.

:information_source: **MongoDB** `3.2` **or later is required.**

- [Official Website](https://www.mongodb.com/)
- [Installation Guide](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/)

It can safely be installed on the same server as Wiki.js. MongoDB is mainly used for users and content metadata, which is very light on server resources usage.

Replica Set / Sharded Cluster installations are fully supported.

Should you prefer on having a cloud provider host the MongoDB instance for you, here's a few examples:

- [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas)
- [mLab](https://mlab.com/)
- [Compose (IBM)](https://www.compose.com/mongodb)
- [ObjectRocket (rackspace)](http://objectrocket.com/mongodb/)

>Â :warning: **Cloud Provider Considerations**
>
> Make sure the MongoDB instance runs in the same datacenter (preferrably) or the same region. Connecting to instances located in another location will result in latency and poor performances!
