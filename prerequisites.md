<!-- SUBTITLE: A quick summary of Prerequisites -->

Requarks Wiki is cross-platform (Windows, Linux and Mac) and does not depend on any paid commercial product / service.

While Requarks Wiki runs on pretty much any platform that supports the requirements below, the following environments are recommended and more thoroughly tested:

- Ubuntu Server 14.04 LTS / 16.04 LTS
- Windows Server 2012 R2

# Requirements
## Node.js

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient.

**Node.js** `v.4.6.0` **or later is required.**

If you are running Linux, you can [install Node.js using the package manager](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/).

The following modern browsers are supported:

- Google Chrome
- Mozilla Firefox
- Microsoft Internet Explorer 10, 11
