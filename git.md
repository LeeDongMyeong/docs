# What is Git

# Why do I need it?
Because the documentation you write should always be stored in a safe location. Even though databases and file storages can be configured to have backups, they are either costly or ineffective. Storing documents into a Git repository not only make sense, it's cost effective (free in most cases), fast and safe.

Having all your documentation in a central Git repository means you control 100% of your data at all times.
- Want to modify that content outside the Wiki? **You can**.
- Want to transfer content somewhere else? **You can**.
- You want to completely stop using Wiki.js? Hopefully not, but should you want to, **you can** and there's nothing to extract or backup because everything is already in that Git repository.
